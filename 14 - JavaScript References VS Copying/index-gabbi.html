            // Let's say we have an array
            const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

            const team = players

            // You might think we can just do something like this:
            // team[3] = 'Lux'
            // however what happens when we update that array?
                // The team array will always update to be the same as the players array, unlike what happened earlier with the strings

            // now here is the problem!

            // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

            // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

            // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

            // one way
            const team2 = players.slice()

            // or create a new array and concat the old one in
            const team3 = [].concat(players)
            // or use the new ES6 Spread
            const team4 = [...players]
            // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
            team4[3] = "birdie"

            team5 = Array.from(players)
            // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

            // with Objects
            const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
            };

            // and think we make a copy:
            // const captain = person // bad stuff
            // how do we take a copy instead?
            const theCaptain = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
            console.log(person, theCaptain)
            // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
            const elCapitan = {...person}
            // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
